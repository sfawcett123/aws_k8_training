## Introduction

We do not want to be manually installing tools on our bastion and we want to be able access our system using aws cli or ansible from the bastion.
## Goals

1. Implement a script that installs certain tools when the bastion is built.
1. Enable the Bastion to run AWS CLI without the need to configure users.
